## Project Reflection

### Functionality
*I feel as if I was able to make a very well functioning program. objects are split correctly, and I was able to crypt and decrypt precisely. I feel that it was very tough for me to not have a clear outline, but I was able to achieve the goal.*
### Object Oriented Programming
*I felt that I separated my objects and modules pretty well, amthough I think I could've done a better job. I like my objects to be nice and short, and it was certainly tough to do so thinking big picture rather than having a solidified interaction pattern for every object I created.*
### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
*I've felt that one of my strongest suits is making sure formatting is strong (indenting, spacing, etc.). One of my weaker areas is making sure that enumerables are as efficient as possible, and that my methods are less than 10 lines long. I felt I did a really good job in making sure my methods were concise, but I'm still shaky on my enumerable usage.*
### Test Driven Development 
*I used stubs frequently and effectively, and I made a solid point to create tests before methods. My SimpleCov is at 100%, so I feel confident, but I know that doesn't necessarily mean that I tested as tightly as I could.. So I have high hopes, but am also eager for feedback.*
